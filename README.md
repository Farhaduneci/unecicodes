This repository contains the **Jekyll related files and data of my personal blog**. 🌐 Jekyll is a blog-aware static site
generator in Ruby, Jekyll was my first-ever experience with a SSG, and I felt in love with it, so I made my decision to
implement a portfolio or blog of my own with it and share what I feel and what I find intreating 🤩 about computers & life
with people.

## 💖&nbsp; Make sure to check it out

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based
CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website
ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which you
can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

### Philosophy

Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions,
nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows
you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
